# Syncing with bani's spreadsheet

see https://github.com/bani/101weiqiLocalizer

1) Download the spreadsheet as tsv

2) Convert those translations so we can compare them with ours

    cat 101weiqiLocalizer\ translations\ -\ translations.tsv | \
        tail -n +2 | cut -f 2,3 | sort -r >t.tsv

3) Prepare our translations for comparisons

    sort -r translations.tsv | sponge translations.tsv

4) Compare and edit the translations

    vimdiff translations.tsv ~/Downloads/t.tsv

5) Update content.js

    perl -lnE'@s = split /\t/; say qq!    "$s[0]" : "$s[1]",!' translations.tsv

and paste that into content.js.

FIXME this could be automated but works well enough for now.

6) Create a diff of translations

    diff -C 3 translations.tsv ~/Downloads/t.tsv >firefox.diff

So in firefox.diff you can see what is different from our translations to the
Firefox port's translations.
