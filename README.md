# Localize 101weiqi.com pages to English

[101weiqi.com](https://101weiqi.com) is a Chinese-language web site where you
can solve problems for the Go board game. Unfortunately there is no
English-language localization of that website. This extension aims to make it
easier for those of us who don't read Chinese to use that site. The extension
adds a script to 101weiqi.com's web pages which translates strings to English.
It does not alter the functionality of 101weiqi.com in any way.

## Firefox

There is a [Firefox port](https://github.com/bani/101weiqiLocalizer) of this
extension. I have backported translations from that port.
